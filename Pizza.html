    <h1>"VEGITARIAN PIZZA LOVERS RECIPE"</h1>
    <h3>"A Hint Of Sweet Potato" </h3>

    <p> Now the pizza, It is by no means a traditional pizza, but itâ€™s seriously delicious. Veggie-packed, easy to make, both vegan and gluten-free, easy to adapt and most importantly so tasty.Anya originally tops her pizza with a carrot top chimichurri, I went with parsley here, which is the traditional way of making chimichurri. This pizza is really well balanced, from the sweetness of the sweet potato crust, to the smoky flavour of the roasted eggplant, the juiciness of the bell pepper, and the punch of the garlicky chimichurri. I'll surely double the recipe next time because the only downside is it's always gone way too fast.:) </p>

      <h4>To Make The Chimichurri</h4>
      <p>In a food processor or blender, combine the parsley, garlic, red wine vinegar, salt, red pepper flakes, and black pepper to taste. Pulse into a chunky puree. With the motor running, slowly pour the olive oil and continue blending until everything is well incorporated.</p>
      <p>Taste and adjust seasoning by adding more garlic, salt or pepper flakes, as needed. Transfer the chimichurri to an air-tight jar and keep in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</p>
      <div class="Crust">

        <h4>To make the crust and bake the pizza</h4>
        <p> Combine the mashed sweet potato, minced garlic, salt, pepper, flour, baking powder, apple cider vinegar, and 1/2 tablespoon of the oil in a food processor. Pulse to combine, scraping the sides if needed. You should end up with a soft and sticky dough.</p>
        <p>Coat the bottom of a 10-inch cast iron skillet with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of oil. Scrape the dough into the skillet and use oiled hands to spread it out in an even layer. Push some of the dough slightly up the sides of the pan to create a border.</p>
        <p>Place the skillet in the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the edges are slightly browned.</p>
        <p>Carefully remove the skillet from the oven. Spread the mashed garlic over the crust with a fork. Arrange the eggplant and pepper slices on top and sprinkled with the paprika. Return the skillet to the oven and bake for another 10 minutes until the crust is golden and the vegetables are heated through.</p>
        <p>Remove the skillet from the oven, let it cool slightly, and slide the pizza onto a cutting board. Slice and serve the pizza topped with chimichurri.</p>
        <p>*Steam or boil the sweet potato until completely soft, or prick with a fork and bake it in the oven for about 40 minutes. Once cooked, mash with a fork and measure out 1 cup, reserving any excess for another dish.</p>
